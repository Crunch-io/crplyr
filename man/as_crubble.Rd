\description{
Crunch Cubes can be expressed as a long data frame instead of a
multidimensional array. In this form each dimension of the cube is a variable
and the cube values are expressed as columns for each measure. This is useful
both to better understand what each entry of a cube represents, and to work
with the cube result using tidyverse tools.
