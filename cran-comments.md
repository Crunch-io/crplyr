* This release comes just 1 day after a previous release, unfortunately
  while preparing for a release of an upstream dependency I must have forgotten
  to check the crplyr package with building of vignettes. This fix is needed
  for the upcoming version 1.27.0 of crunch. I appologize for any inconvenience.
