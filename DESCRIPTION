Title: A 'dplyr' Interface for Crunch
Description: In order to facilitate analysis of datasets hosted on the Crunch
    data platform <http://crunch.io/>, the 'crplyr' package implements 'dplyr'
    methods on top of the Crunch backend. The usual methods 'select', 'filter',
    'mutate', 'group_by', and 'summarize' are implemented in such a way as to
    perform as much computation on the server and pull as little data locally
    as possible.
