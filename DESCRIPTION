Title: A 'dplyr' Interface for Crunch
Description: In order to facilitate analysis of datasets hosted by Crunch, the
    'crplyr' package implements 'dplyr' methods on top of the Crunch backend.
    The usual methods "select", "filter", "mutate", "group_by", and "summarize"
    are implemented in such a way as to perform as much computation on the
    server and pull as little data locally as possible.
